              <h3>The Kids Are Alright</h3>
              <p>While new subcultures of young people caused uproar in 1960s Europe, organized youth movements in the USSR remained in place well after 1989. Today, youth clubs in Russia are still a popular way to help gifted kids succeed better in
                society and to help kids escape disadvantaged backgrounds. During a two week stay in St. Petersburg we researched youth movements and youth rights, and visited three of the 26 different youth clubs in Petrogradsky district.</p>
              <p class="indent">News about militant youth movements like <i>Nashi</i> heavily influence the image of the Russian youth in the rest of the world. Working with Russian curators, and the collaboration with Russian designer Roman
                Gornitsky, helped me to understand cultural differences about education and youth in Russia.</p>

              <p>The Netherlands is one of the safest, happiest, and richest countries in the world. Unemployment is one of the lowest in Europe. Crime has been dropping for the last eleven years, and the number of murders is among the lowest in
                Europe. The Dutch are also very socially active, they do more voluntary work than any other country in Europe, and according to the UN the Netherlands is the best country to raise your kid in the world. So what are the Dutch suddenly
                so afraid of?</p>

              <p>To find out I teamed up with Stephan Okhuijsen, a data-analist who publishes graphs on his platform <a href="http://www.datagraver.com" target="_blank">Datagraver</a>. I read the election programmes of the political parties,
                collected quotes by politicians, and organized them by theme. The most discussed themes this election were terrorism, security, immigration, refugees, Islam, pensions, and healthcare. Stephan took graphs and data sets that he
                collected over the years, and we looked for recent statistics on the themes. From all the material we collected, it showed many statements by politicians were either exaggerated or false.</p>

              <h3>Fear of Muslims</h3>
              <p>‘Is Islam a threat to Dutch society?’ was actually a question during two political debates on Dutch television. Asking the same about Christianity or Judaism would be unfathomable. This normalisation of xenophobia was only possible
                through the strong anti-Islam rhetoric from the PVV party which had introduced the word ‘islamification’ in the Dutch political language. Their election programme said: ‘Millions of Dutch are fed up with the islamification of our
                country’. VNL, a new right-wing populist party said in their programme: ‘The largest problem is the mass-immigration, the tidal wave of islamification’. We understood the use of the term ‘islamification’ is problematic in itself, but
                since it was such a big topic during the elections, we felt we had to address it.</p>

              <p>The Meuse (<i>Maas</i> in Dutch) flows through five countries, along the residential areas of nine million people, where three different languages and twenty-two dialects are spoken. The river brings great prosperity but also causes
                floods and droughts. Large portions of the Meuse valley are particularly at risk. For centuries, people in the Meuse region have lived with the threat of flooding, developing all kinds of self-sufficiency. <i>Maas Paradox</i> surveys
                these experiences and seeks possible answers to the question of whether and how climate change will alter life on the banks of the Meuse. Together with Han Dijk, urban planner at <a href="http://www.posad.nl" target="_blank">Posad
                  spatial strategies</a>, I was invited by Saskia van Stein, director of Bureau Europa in Maastricht, to be the curator and designer of <i>Maas Paradox</i>.</p>

              <h3>Floating villas in drowning cities</h3>
              <p>Many exhibitions discuss climate change in a global context, but scrutinizing its local effects are far more difficult. The city of Maastricht lies in the utmost southern part of the Netherlands, bordering on Germany and Belgium. Its
                hilly landscape is very different from the flat western part, where the majority of the Dutch live and the national government is housed. To ensure that the message of the exhibition would resonate with local inhabitants, the
                exhibition was based on research of the local effects of climate change.</p>
              <p class="indent">As curators we wanted to use the exhibition about the Meuse region to expand the knowledge for design and architecture about climate change to informal solutions by regular citizens. Often enough, plans by designers
                and architects for climate change mitigation or adaptation are luxury solutions such as floating villas or high-tech devices that cater to the survival needs of the richest 1%. This exhibition acknowledges that the effects of climate
                change will be felt by citizens, and we should approach this as collective rather than individual forms of adaptation. This is why we invited artist Klaas Burger to conduct interviews with people living in flood-prone areas about
                their experiences.</p>

                <img src="img/5/3.jpg" alt="Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium.">

              <h3>Research</h3>
              <p>During three months, Untold Stories and the urban planners and architects from Posad, with help of the University of Maastricht premium programme conducted research. The region’s climate, history, and hydrography was explored through
                three paradoxes: scarcity and abundance, border and connection, and source and drain. During the process, the research was shared with artists who were commissioned to create new works for the exhibition.</p>
              <p class="indent">The research resulted in a detailed 16 meter long map of the Meuse basin on the wall of the museum, with marked flood-prone areas, industrial areas and nuclear power plants, drinking water intake areas, and sewage
                plants. The map, made by Posad, also functioned as an exhibition guide, and was distributed for free in a foldable version.</p>
              <p class="indent">The local impact of each paradox was further explained in wall texts and in the museum guide. We looked into the local effects of pollution, flood, drought, biodiversity, water quality, water temperature, and drinking
                water. To distill all this information for a larger audience, the main conclusions of the research were summarized into one large infographic with facts about the impact of climate change on the region.</p>

              <p>Social and sustainable design is gaining momentum. Designers are developing ways of production that are less harmful or use waste materials more effectively. The ideas of social and sustainable design are not new. Design history is
                full of examples that can be very useful for today’s questions. Theorist and designer <a href="http://dirty-design.net" target="_blank">Marjanne van Helvert</a> collected ideas from the history of social and sustainable design in
                <i>The Responsible Object: A History of Design Ideology for the Future</i>.</p>

              <p>The eleven chapters in the book are written by different authors, and treat topics like William Morris, the Bauhaus and its Russian counterpart VKhUTEMAS, Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky, Utility design from the U.K., Buckminster Fuller,
                Victor Papanek, the Italian avant-garde, queer design, Fab Labs and DIY culture in Brazil, and speculative design. To give insight into what the book has to offer, I will shortly introduce the chapter by Elizabeth Carolyn Miller on
                William Morris and his Kelmscott Press. </p>
              <p class="indent">William Morris (1834-1896) was a designer from the U.K., as wel as a socialist, an activist, and author. In response to the exploitation of labor in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, he practiced design with socialist
                ideals. His Kelmscott Press produced high quality books and magazines which were made to last, in response to the wasteful abundance of print production of that time. Workers at the press were unionized and were paid good wages. His
                printing press is an example of responsible design but this made production very expensive, and the books became luxury items to his own disappointment. A paradox still encountered today by designers who are looking for sustainable
                production methods.</p>

                <img src="img/1.png" alt="Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium.">

              <h3>Concept</h3>
              <p><i>The Responsible Object</i> is a book about design without images, so the book design needed to accommodate a good reading experience, and easy navigation. The book has an important additional function as a reference document, with
                many notes and references to other books and authors.</p>
              <p class="indent">The layout was inspired by manuscripts from Medieval Europe. These handdrawn texts had wide margins where other authors would comment or write notes. Over time this resulted in a dialogue between authors in the margins
                of the page. This layout allowed readers to use the book to add notes and comments much like the Medieval manuscripts. For easy reading and contrast with the large margins, the type was set at 14 points. With the author and publisher
                it was decided small images and book covers of cited works were added to the margin. Images were added not for aesthetic reasons but as academic references.</p>

                <img src="img/1.png" alt="Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium.">

              <p class="indent">Although the book is an historical overview, it is not an objective record of design history. The author stresses the urgency of changing the design profession into a less polluting and exploitative discipline. This
                book is a radical call to action that takes its inspiration from the past. I decided to add a second layer to facilitate this message. The text accomodates many excellent quotes from designers from the past who were passionate about
                changing design for the better, like Victor Papanek, William Morris, Walter Gropius, and others. I collected the most powerful quotes from the book to function as they were from protest signs or a manifesto. These quotes were typeset
                in a custom typeface in all capitals, and spread evenly across the book, breaking up chapters randomly. Typeset on a spread in horizontal orientation, the reader has to turn the page to read the quote, breaking act of reading. Since
                every quote was in the same typeface, and had no credit on the page (credits were placed on the back), the messages are meant to have impact beyond the author and the era they originated from. The quotes functioned as a series of
                posters within the book.</p>

              <h3>Type</h3>
              <p>The text is typeset in Founders Grotesk text and regular, designed by Kris Sowersby and published by Klim foundry in 2013. As Klim explains on its <a href="https://klim.co.nz/blog/founders-grotesk-design-information/"
                  target="_blank">blog</a>, Founders Grotesk was inspired by the specimen of Grotesque by Miller & Richard from 1912, and influenced by designs such as Breite grotesk (1909) and Doric (1919). Founders Grotesk is wider and is less
                rigid than later sans-serifs such as Helvetica (Max Miedinger, 1957) or Akkurat (Laurenz Brunner, 2004). The first sans-serifs that were designed in the early 1900s had a radical impact since the vast majority of communication was
                designed using serifs. Early grotesk designs helped spawn the modernist design era, and they can be found on the Bauhaus books and magazines. Since this book revolves around different ideas around modernist design in Western Europe,
                it seemed fitting to choose a sans-serif based on that early radical period of modernist type design.</p>

                <img src="img/1.png" alt="Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium.">

              <p class="indent">For the quotes I created a new display typeface. Its design is based on stencil typefaces used in architectural drawings in the 1950s and 1960s. The angular style and letter construction have the futuristic feel to it,
                which seemed appropriate since the book’s content talks about ideas of utopia (and failed utopias) from the past. The quotes talk about different forms of utopias and dystopias without referring to a specific time or place. Since each
                quote has a different length and emphasis, I manually broadened or narrowed the typeface to accommodate the quote. Much like the letters on protest signs are made to fit the space and message, rather than follow a type design grid.
              </p>

              <img src="img/1.png" alt="Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium.">

              <h3>Paper and colour</h3>
              <p>All typography was printed in an off-black spot colour on Munken print white. The initial idea was that the quotes could be torn out of the book. However a limited production budget could not allow a different paper type for the
                quotes, so an extra orange spot colour was used. The colour was chosen to go against cliché references to sustainability like grey, brown, and green. The book was perfect bound with cold glue, so it opens easy and reads comfortably.

              <p>You are privileged. Just reading this sentence makes you part of the 85% of the world population that is literate, the 20% that understands English, and the 40% that has access to the internet. Visual communication is not an even
                playing field, but is dominated by the urban regions, primarily in the Northern hemisphere. The design of visual communication is shaped by the designers’ cultural and political bias. Designers themselves are often unaware of this.
                <i>The Politics of Design</i> is a book that shows the cultural and political bias of visual communication using visual examples.</p>

              <p>When most of us think of the word politics, we think of the daily political practice; elected leaders, voting, parliaments, political parties, etc. But politics are in effect principles of power and status that function outside of
                this sphere as well. They are present in everything we do, think, in the way we talk, the way we dress, and the way we design. The political system in which the designer works and lives cannot be disconnected from the design she/he
                creates. A political ideology is continuously being produced and communicated through design. Acknowledging this can give designers more agency in their practice to “either serve or subvert the status quo”, as Tony Fry said.</p>

              <h3>Military Bodies</h3>
              <p>A very clear example of how design becomes political is through standards. In 1959 the U.S. designer Henry Dreyfuss published <i>The Measure of Man</i>, a seminal book which is still being taught at design schools. Dreyfuss had the
                insight that designers should use the measurements of the human body to create more human-centred design. This helped push design and architecture forward but also created a false sense of truth. The measurements of the men in
                Dreyfuss’ book are based on data from the U.S. military. They represent bodies of a specific type, age, and height which is anything but universal. The binary gender division (male/female) establishes a very conservative idea of
                gender, unlike the way that gender is perceived in society. For instance in 2014, Facebook introduced 58 choices in gender identity for its users.</p>

                <img src="img/1.png" alt="Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium.">

              <p class="indent">A well-known example of standards in visual communication are the pictograms used for signing. These pictograms were designed in 1974 for the U.S. Department of Transportation, and later adopted by the international
                organisation of standards as ISO 7001. They are used worldwide and are so ubiquitous we might not notice its cultural and political bias. The male icon is used for both a male and a person (m/f), while the female icon is only used to
                signify the female gender. The pictogram for ticket counter is a women selling a ticket to a man. The pictogram for restaurant is a knife and fork, which are Western eating utensils. The pictogram for parking uses the letter ‘P’ of
                the Latin alphabet for the English word ‘Parking’. The ISO 7001 system of pictograms is not neutral or universal, but in fact communicates Western values and outdated ideas of gender.</p>

              <h3 style="color: #ff0087">Fake Diversity</h3>
              <p style="color: #ff0087">Many of the objects in this image are so ‘normal’ that we do not even realise they are biased until we see them together. Band-Aids for darker skin colours have only been available since 1998. The way race is
                perceived in society is shaped by designers, not just in products, but also in visual communication.</p>

                <img src="img/1.png" alt="Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium.">

              <p class="indent" style="color: #ff0087">In recent decades, the world of corporate communication has been focusing heavily on diversity. Every major company now has a diversity program that emphasises the value of a multi-ethnic and
                gender-equal workforce. On the website of the U.S. company Northrop Grumman we find a diversity page with a photo of an ethnically diverse group of employees. It all looks a little too perfect, and when we reverse search the image we
                find the same image is used at the Central Ohio Diversity Consortium and the French private education office CNFDI. Using stock photos is standard practice in corporate communication, but it can backfire and have the opposite effect
                when communicating diversity. Generic images of an idealised workforce obscures the fact that actual diversity in the workforce is still far behind (in 2015 only 4 of the Fortune 500 companies had a black CEO, and only 24 were women).

              <h3 style="color: #ff0087">Maps and Legends</h3>
              <p style="color: #ff0087">Politics and design are wed together in the world of map-making. Maps have always been a method of exercising control over territory and its peoples and resources. During colonial times, mapping an area was
                sometimes enough to consider it ‘conquered’. World maps have a complicated history. A two-dimensional map of the world is always flawed, since it always distorts somewhat by projecting a sphere on to a flat plane, the so-called
                <i>projection</i>. The best known world map is the Mercator projection, a map from 1569 made for early colonial seafaring by European countries. It is the best known world map and it is still used by Google maps, Apple maps, and Bing
                maps. Mercator has been criticised for being scientifically wrong and colonialist because it places Europe at its centre, and makes the ‘colonised’ continents Africa, Australia, and South-America, look too small in comparison. This is
                a consequence of its optimization for compass directions. This distorts the southern hemisphere enormously. If you look at the Mercator map keep in mind that Australia is in fact 2,5 times larger than Greenland.</p>

                <img src="img/1.png" alt="Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium.">
              <p class="indent" style="color: #ff0087">German filmmaker Arno Peters criticised the Mercator in 1973 for being colonialist and proposed an alternative (Western) world map that showed an equal size comparison. The map is now known as
                the Gall-Peters map and is officially used by the United Nations and British schools. For those used to the Mercator map it might look very strange, even distorted. In fact this map is a very politically correct map when it comes to
                size comparison, because each square is the same size on this map.</p>

              <p>We are facing a humanitarian crisis. There are 60 million displaced persons in the world,<sup>1</sup> and every ten minutes a stateless child is born.<sup>2</sup> Millions of people that have no access to water, food, housing, work,
                education, and are caught in legal limbo. This refugee crisis has inspired many designers to do projects about refugees, the most recent of which is the <i>What design can do (WDCD) Refugee Challenge</i>. Designers that address such
                complex issues as the refugee crisis have to be aware of their responsibilities, since approaching the refugee crisis as a design problem without the proper context can be problematic, even harmful. I want to examine the role of
                designers in the refugee crisis using the <i>WDCD Refugee Challenge</i> as an example.</p>

              <img src="img/1.png" alt="Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium.">

              <p>Launched on February 19, the Netherlands-based <i>WDCD Refugee Challenge</i> invites designers, creative thinkers and problem solvers to come up with ‘bold ideas’ to help refugees. Proposals should be submitted before May 1, 2016,
                with a one minute movie to pitch the idea. The five finalists will be announced at the WDCD conference in Amsterdam on July 1, 2016, and all five receive a 10,000 euro reward to realise their ideas.<sup>4</sup></p>
              <p class="indent">The <i>WDCD Refugee Challenge</i> should be praised for taking the initiative to create a platform for designers that address the refugee crisis. The involvement of the UNHCR as a partner shows the WDCD’s ambition that
                its outcomes could structurally improve the situation of refugees. However, the way the <i>WDCD Refugee Challenge</i> is communicated leaves a lot to be desired. This is important because it already sets the scene for the kind of
                solutions that will be submitted. I want to lay bare some of the blind spots in the design question that WDCD Refugee Challenge has proposed, and examine how designers could assume their responsibilities in addressing such a crisis.

              <h3>The Designer as a Game-changer</h3>
              <p>Dutch newspaper <i>De Volkskrant</i> compared the <i>WDCD Refugee Challenge</i> to <i>Dragons’ Den</i>, a reality television show from the BBC where contestants pitch their ideas to investors.<sup>5</sup> During the <i>WDCD Refugee
                  Challenge</i> five finalist will be chosen, all of whom will receive a 10,000 euro reward. They will go into an ‘accelerator’ in which they create a working prototype and a business plan. After a project pitch one of the five
                designs will be announced as the winner by the end of 2016.</p>
              <p class="indent">The <i>WDCD Refugee Challenge</i> says the refugee crisis is: ‘A global challenge too big for governments and NGO’s alone’. Design as the ultimate problem-solving discipline coincides with the narrative of the
                neoliberal European policies. In recent decades, governments have cut spending on welfare, education, and foreign aid, advocating that free market—including design— can provide a better alternative. The ruling VVD party is
                implementing neoliberal policies in the Netherlands, and has recently proposed to close the Dutch borders for refugees completely.<sup>6</sup></p>
              <p class="indent">First of all, it is absurd to suggest that design can come up with solutions for a crisis that is political and socio-economic at heart. European countries have been intervening in Middle East politics way before the
                Englishman Sykes and the Frenchmen Picot carved out most of the regions’ borders in 1916. More recently, the Dutch military was part of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the war in Afghanistan between 2006-2010. At this moment, Dutch
                F-16’s are bombing Syria and Iraq.<sup>7</sup></p>
              <p class="indent">Another contributing factor to the refugee crisis is the situation of poverty and joblessness in the Global South. Income inequality has only grown with IMF policies, trade barriers, and EU subsidies, which have
                blocked the Global South from equal access to the world economy. As long as these economic barriers are in place, we will see more and more people from the Global South seeking a better life in Europe.</p>
              <p class="indent">By ignoring the history of the refugee crisis and the political reality of diplomacy and military interventions in the Middle East in the briefing, the <i>WDCD Refugee Challenge</i> keeps the root of the problem out of
                sight. Designers can not successfully intervene in the refugee crisis if the political and military interventions are not taken into account. This should be part of the briefing and the debate surrounding the WDCD Refugee Challenge so
                that designers understand their agency or lack thereof.</p>
              <p class="indent">Second, by emphasising the problem-solving capabilities of design, the <i>WDCD Refugee Challenge</i> supports the narrative that the free market is much better at solving the world’s crisis than governments are. Design
                may be able to come up with clever products or enlightening ideas, but only governments and NGOs can provide refugees with the resources, infrastructure, and laws that are needed in the long run. The <i>WDCD Refugee Challenge</i>s’
                good intentions could backfire if designs are used as an incentive for governments to cut their spending on supporting refugees altogether. Therefore the <i>WDCD Refugee Challenge</i> should inform designers about the responsibilities
                of governments and NGOs, and find out how and if designers can effectively intervene.</p>

              <h3>Designing From The Bunker</h3>
              <p>The first <i>WDCD Refugee Challenge</i> is to design a shelter. By shelter the brief means the temporary housing facilities where refugees stay until their request for asylum is accepted or rejected. Designing temporary housing as a
                challenge stands in stark contrast to the permanent reality of refugees staying in asylum centres, refugee camps, and shelters. The Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya is twenty years old, and many refugee camps in Palestine have been there
                since 1948. Generations of people living in temporary conditions is not temporary, but a structural lack of proper infrastructure, housing, and education or job opportunities. In the Netherlands, Yoonis Osman Nuur from the refugee
                collective <i>We Are Here</i> explains how he has been in temporary shelter in the Netherlands for ten years, and others in the group for twelve or thirteen years. All this time unable to work or go to school.<sup>9</sup></p>
              <p class="indent">No matter how well-designed a shelter is, refugees would rather live in a house and use the same infrastructure and opportunities as everyone else. The brief reduces the design question to the formal qualities of the
                shelter, its interior, its architecture, etc. Why call it a shelter and not a house? Why don’t we think of ways to offer refugees the same houses, the same jobs, the same schools as everyone else? Designing temporary shelters is
                exactly how right-wing politicians want to discourage refugees from coming to Europe. To quote VVD party member Halbe Zijlstra, ‘We should make the conditions for refugees as austere as possible, to discourage others from traveling to
                the Netherlands. He imagines container-like housing with minimal available services.<sup>10</sup></p>

                <img src="img/1.png" alt="Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium.">

              <p class="indent">Mark Duffield, from the Global Insecurities Centre at the University of Bristol, has written about the underlying conditions of the architecture that Halbe Zijlstra, and WDCD refer to. In Environmental Terror:
                Uncertainty, Resilience and the Bunker<sup>11</sup> he follows Agamben’s <i>Homo Sacer</i>, ‘if neoliberalism has a spatial form, it is reflected in the complimentarily between the “bunker” and the “camp”’. What he calls the growing
                bunkerisation of the Global North is the larger physical and digital divide between the Global South and the Global North. We can find the bunker in its physical form of the construction of gated communities, fortified UN compounds,
                and the deadly border walls between the EU in Mellila (Morocco) and Evros (Greece). But also in the barriers that are increasingly digital and invisible: biometric passports, VISAs, fingerprinting databases, network access, paywalls,
                trade barriers, and immigration policies.</p>
              <p class="indent">In the Global South, the architectural archetype is the tent, the temporary housing structures like tent camps, asylum centres, slums, and extra-judicial confinement. While the inhabitants of the Global North can
                travel freely, with unlimited access to resources, networks and travel destinations, people of the Global South are trapped in legal limbo, surrounded by gates, fences, without visas or passports, unable to cross frontiers. The
                proliferation of network technologies has allowed a permanent ‘remote control’ scenario to arise, and the bunker is increasingly becoming a control centre. With military drones, conflicts are fought from a distance. At the same time
                the UNHCR is using biometric identification to register refugees, and UN Food programme has refugees paying for food using iris scan technology in refugee camps.<sup>12</sup> This analogy of the bunker and the tent is not just an
                abstraction of the world’s inequality, it is also to show that this divide is very much designed.
                <p class="indent">Designers should be aware their work does not end up being used to legitimise a state of permanent temporary living, deliberately created to prevent refugees from coming to Europe. They could instead imagine
                  political or practical solutions that allow refugees the same rights as everyone else, so they have access to the same houses, education, services, and rights as we do. Otherwise designers are affirming the horrible reality of a
                  growing global underclass of the stateless permanently living in shelters, not houses.</p>

                <h3>Designing Violence</h3>
                <p>The <i>WDCD refugee challenge</i> frames the refugee crisis as a design challenge. But the refugee crisis is already very much designed. Designers have played an active role in designing the digital and physical borders to make
                  sure refugees are prevented from entering Europe. Since 2004, the EU has invested heavily in fortifying its borders. The European border patrol Frontex has already spent 670 million since 2004, as the researchers from the Migrant
                  files have shown.<sup>13</sup> Since then new border fences have been built and equipped with smart surveillance technology. The latest border control systems of the EU are becoming digital and invisible. The OPARUS program that is
                  being developed uses military drones, satellites, and smart surveillance technology to create a virtual net around Europe. Dutch tech companies are designing biometric software and digital ‘sniff’ technology that can locate refugees
                  even before they reach border crossings.</p>
                <p class="indent">The militarised borders of Europe are designed to remove violence out of sight of the European citizen. Many Frontex operations are done at sea, invisible from the European mainland. The thousands of people that
                  drown trying to cross the Mediterranean are not only the blame of human traffickers, as Forensic Architecture has convincingly shown in their project ‘Left-to-Die Boat’.<sup>14</sup> NATO ships that were in close to a sinking boat
                  full of refugees, did nothing and let the passengers drown. If Europe designs highly militarised borders, it cannot deny the responsibilities of casualties and fatalities that occur.
                  <p class="indent">Inside Europe, a network of prison-like structures is set up. Much of this infrastructure is deliberately invisible. Asylum centres are usually built in remote places, out of sight from most Europeans. Deportation
                    of refugees in the U.K. is done through a network of detention centres, closed courts, and airlines. Taking photographs of these spaces is illegal. Artist James Bridle interviewed people to create images of these invisible spaces
                    in his work ‘Seamless Transitions’ from 2015, in other to visualise this hidden violence.<sup>15</sup>
                    <p class="indent">Europe is already spending so much effort to design systems and campaigns to keep refugees out in the first place, so why is this not part of the <i>WDCD Refugee challenge</i>? For instance, designers can help to
                      lay bare these invisible systems of violence on Europe’s borders and find out how refugees can circumvent them.</p>

                      <img src="img/1.png" alt="Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium.">

                    <h3>Designing Exclusion</h3>
                    <p>On the website of the <i>WDCD Refugee Challenge</i> an image of refugees is shown standing in line, covered with blankets, aided by UNHCR workers. The tagline says, ‘Here’s your chance to make a difference’. The headline is not
                      directed at refugees, but at designers, so they will join the design challenge. By using this kind of imagery, the <i>WDCD Refugee Challenge</i> puts designers in opposition to the refugee. The refugee is presented as helpless,
                      with problems for which the designer offers her/his help. The notion that a refugee is perhaps also a designer is not fathomable here.</p>
                    <p class="indent">This image stands in stark reality to the photographs a student of mine showed me, who works on a project with refugees, that a Syrian refugee had made with his cell phone during his trip. Group photos of young
                      men posing cheerfully at landmarks in different places in Europe, no blankets, no sad faces. Those images would never be used on the WDCD website, because they do not fit the intended narrative. Refugees are depicted as victims
                      to raise feelings of empathy with the designer, who is considered to be outside the group of refugees. ‘Participating in this contest will make you feel good!’ says WDCD elsewhere on their website.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The brief states that refugees themselves are encouraged to participate, which would only make sense. After all who can better research, assess, and come up with solutions, than the very people whom it concerns?
                      But in its communication the refugees are placed in opposition to the designer, and how refugees themselves are involved in the process is rather vague: ‘The WDCD Refugee Challenge will foster collaboration with refugees.’</p>
                    <p class="indent">The same emphasis on difference is used by anti-immigration parties to show that refugees are different in culture, religion and background, in opposition to ‘Europeans’ and ‘European values’ (whatever is meant
                      by that). Is a refugee who lives in Europe for ten years still a refugee? In framing the refugee crisis as a design challenge it is especially important to be specific who it is meant for. Creating images and texts to represent
                      either refugees or designers should be done carefully, in order not to reaffirm the stereotypes which have led to so much of the polarised debate which they mention in the brief.</p>

                      <img src="img/1.png" alt="Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium.">

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>First of all, the <i>WDCD Refugee Challenge</i> deserves credit that it raises awareness among professional designers and the public that this humanitarian crisis should be addressed. When it concerns the lives of so many in a
                      humanitarian crisis of this scale, we should be careful in how we frame a crisis and represent the lives of others. The <i>WDCD Refugee Challenge</i> fails to acknowledge its own political position as an actor in the refugee
                      crisis, and does not address the responsibilities of designers themselves. If designers want to play an active role in global crises they have to understand the history of design and how design is complicit to many of the
                      problems we face today. The design discipline will not be taken seriously if we do not address the political structures in which design is practiced and actively shape the world.</p>
                    <p class="indent">I would wholeheartedly invite designers (and everyone else for that matter) to imagine ways to improve the life of refugees. But the refugee crisis has to be understood in its totality, and cannot be seen as an
                      isolated design issue. A shelter is not just a shelter, a campaign is not just a campaign, they relate to larger political ideologies and sentiments. If we do not take the impact that design has on the world seriously, design
                      for good can do more harm than good.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The way the <i>WDCD Refugee Challenge</i> is now framed and communicated, its results are likely to be limited to incidental interventions, because the true nature of the crisis is not addressed. My advice to the
                      <i>WDCD Refugee Challenge</i> is to become less focused on problem-solving and more focused on understanding what the problems are, in order to reflect if and how the refugee crisis should be addressed as a design problem.
                      <p class="indent">These are precarious issues with uncertain outcomes. Maybe design can offer solutions, maybe not. The real challenge would be to create a platform where such complexities and contradictions are not ignored, but
                        embraced, and become part of a larger discussion about what design really can do.</p>

              <p>In May of 2013, the eyes of the world were opened to the electronic mass surveillance which is being carried out by the US, the UK, and their allies. Through the efforts of former NSA-contractor Edward Snowden, journalist Glenn
                Greenwald, and filmmaker Laura Poitras, it became known that everyone with a cell phone or a laptop is a target of electronic surveillance. The complexity of the surveillance technologies make it difficult to understand their impact.
                I wanted to inform people through a series of puzzles about espionage and electronic surveillance tactics.</p>

                <img src="img/1.png" alt="Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium.">

              <p>A few decades ago the eavesdropping by governments was limited to tapping telephones, opening snail mail, and intercepting radio traffic. The worldwide adoption of internet and cell phones has created tremendous opportunities for
                signals intelligence gathering. Government intelligence agencies like the NSA (US) and GCHQ (UK), who are in charge of spying on foreign communication in the interest of national security, have begun to collect bulk digital
                communication from both citizens and military, both domestic and abroad.</p>

                <img src="img/1.png" alt="Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium.">

              <h3>MJOLNIR, OLYMPUSFIRE, AND MYSTIC</h3>
              <p>The immense power of electronic surveillance is reflected in the names of the NSA’s operations. Having the world’s secrets at your disposal has led to names like: <i>Darkthunder, Mystic, Godsurge, Halluxwater, Mjolnir,
                  Olympusfire</i>, and <i>Waterwitch</i>. The history of secret writing has always been associated with the occult and the religious. Names of gods and holy places were encrypted to protect their sanctity. In Roman times an amulet
                with the triangular typography of the incantation ‘Abracadabra’ was worn in an amulet to ward off disease and misfortune. The phrase is from Aramaic and means “I create as I speak”. In Iran, ‘Abjad’ diagrams used religious numerology.
                Indian mathematics (400-1200 AD) used geometry for religious and magic Vedic rituals.</p>

                <img src="img/1.png" alt="Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium.">

              <h3>THE BLACK CHAMBERS</h3>
              <p>Throughout history, encryption has been used to communicate state and military secrets. Julius Caesar used encryption to protect military messages, with a system which we now call the Caesar cipher. Herodotus mentions the Greek
                Histiaeus who shaved the head of his most trusted slave and tattooed a message on it. As soon as the hair had grown back, the slave was sent to deliver the message. The Spartans used a scytale, a strip of parchment with a message on
                it. Only those who possessed a stick of the right diameter could read the message by winding the parchment around the stick.</p>

              <p class="indent">In the 1700s city states and countries in Europe were in a constant state of rivalry. Secret codes were used for diplomatic communication, and each tried desperately to decipher each other’s messages. Diplomatic mail
                was read and deciphered in secret rooms called ‘black chambers’. The <i>Geheime Kabinets-Kanzlei</i> of Vienna was supposedly the best in Europe. Diplomatic letters that arrived at 7 a.m. were opened, copied, resealed with forged
                seals, and returned to the post office at 9:30 a.m.</p>

                <img src="img/1.png" alt="Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium.">

              <h3>TOO MANY SECRETS</h3>
              <p>Cryptography is the process of communicating in, or deciphering, secret writings. In cryptography the original message is called ‘plaintext’ and it is encrypted into unreadable text called ‘ciphertext’. For example the Caesar cipher
                is a simple substitution cipher that shifts the alphabet, so for example A=B, R=S and Z=A, etc. The plaintext ‘SECRET’ becomes ciphertext ‘TFDSFU’. In order to read the message the recipient has to know the key. This code is easy to
                break, but the more variables you add, the more difficult it becomes. Modern ciphers use large prime numbers to withstand decryption by powerful computers.</p>

              <p class="indent">The form of cryptography that hides messages is called steganography. In ancient Greece, Herodotus mentions inscribing a message in wood, covering it with wax, and inscribing the wax with an innocent message. Invisible
                inks and microdots are both examples of steganography which were used during World War II. Digital steganography can be done by adding a message to the source code of images, songs, or videos, and uploading them, hiding them in plain
                sight. Another form of digital steganography was used by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Recovered laptops showed that the Taliban masked their e-mails as spam so they would not be searched by surveillance filters.</p>

                <img src="img/1.png" alt="Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium.">

              <h3>SATELLITES AND ZERO DAYS</h3>
              <p>The possibilities of electronic surveillance has led intelligence agencies to try all possible methods. Cell phone providers and internet companies are pressured to give their data to intelligence agencies, or to give secret access
                into their software. Intelligence agencies design special programs that use vulnerabilities in operating systems and browsers (called zero days) to intercept e-mails, chats, and voice IP calls. Undersea communication cables that
                connect continents to the internet are directly tapped into. The NSA even developed tiny spy hardware, which is secretly installed into intercepted laptops and cell phones that people had ordered online.</p>

              <p class="indent">Both the NSA and the GCHQ deny that they spy on their own citizens, while Edward Snowden’s documents have proved otherwise. The documents also showed that these agencies spy on their allies as well as their
                adversaries. Courts have ruled since then that both agencies were guilty of illegally collecting phone records and bulk internet communication. In addition, software companies have stepped up and promised to use encryption for
                communication platforms, so government agencies can no longer read them.</p>

                <img src="img/1.png" alt="Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium.">

              <h3>PUZZLES AND PRIVACY</h3>
              <p>The leaks by Edward Snowden and the history of cryptography formed the basis for a series of ‘Spy Puzzles’. Dutch newspaper NRC Next published one puzzle every week starting February 2014. Every Tuesday, Dutch readers could find a
                new spy puzzle in their newspaper and try their puzzling skills, while learning something about the impact of electronic surveillance. One year later I had made more than 52 puzzles with different topics such as satellite
                surveillance, man-in-the-middle attacks, Russian electronic surveillance, and face recognition.

              <h3>Death Metal</h3>
              <p>Sonic violence is not a new phenomenon. In <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/sonic-warfare" target="_blank">‘Sonic Warfare’</a>, author Steve Goodman calls it ‘virtualized fear: ‘fear induced purely by sound effects, or at
                least the undecidability between an actual’ or ‘sonic attack’. In World War II the German Luftwaffe mounted sirens on the Ju-87 B-1 ‘stuka’ dive bomber. The horrifying, screeching sound was played during dive-bombing to strike the
                population with fear before the bombs would fall.</p>
              <p class="indent">In 2005 the Israeli military used various methods of sonic warfare against the Palestinian population. ‘Sound bombs’ were deployed at night over Gaza; low-flying jets that break the sound barrier. Witnesses compared it
                to a large explosion, causing nose-bleeds, broken windows, and anxiety attacks. The Israeli army used special sonic weapons like the Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) as well. This ‘sound cannon’ was employed by city police against
                Occupy protesters in New York and recently in Ferguson, Missouri. Mounted on vehicles, it blasts a painfully loud siren in the direction it is pointed.</p>
              <p class="indent">Music has been used as a weapon of torture at Guantánamo Bay prison. Metallica’s ‘Enter Sandman’ was played at extremely loud volume for hours on end, something that singer James Hetfield only applauded. He said “If
                the Iraqis aren't used to freedom, then I'm glad to be part of their exposure”. Using loud music in between interrogation sessions, it would take four days to ‘break’ someone, according to an interrogator.</p>

              <p>While the buzzing of drones is striking fear and terror, the drone operators are thousands of miles away without any audio feedback. Even the video feed is out of sync. Images taken with an infrared camera attached to the drone are
                transmitted by satellite with a two-to-five-second time lapse. Drone operators need to be immersed in sensory input for so-called situational awareness. Like playing a video game, their input is limited to a mediated representation.
                But gamers use surround sound speakers. Drone operators on the other hand, are less immersed. Their video feed is silent, abstracted, dehumanized. The absence of the sounds of war stands in stark contrast to the terror of the engine
                sounds over areas of conflict. The asymmetry of sound emphasizes how conflicts are increasingly fought far away, remotely controlled.</p>

              <p>The word drone comes from old English and is both the name for the male honeybee and the sound it produces. This buzzing sound or ‘drone’ is similar to engine noise, and it has become a synonym for unmanned aircraft. The border area
                between Afghanistan and Pakistan is where the sounds of military drones have been heard frequently. Drones are called <i>bangana</i> (بنګنه) for their eerie sound, which is Pashto for buzzing wasp. “They look at the sky to see if
                there are drones. The drones make such a noise that everyone is scared.” said an inhabitant of the region in the Stanford/NYU study ‘Living under drones’. The study has documented people’s experiences and reported cases of post
                traumatic stress syndrome as a result of the drone sounds.</p>
              <p class="indent">Journalist David Rohde was held captive by the Taliban and describes what it is like living under drones. “The drones were terrifying. From the ground, it is impossible to determine who or what they are tracking as
                they circle overhead. The buzz of a distant propeller is a constant reminder of imminent death.” Over the city of Gaza the Israeli drones are nicknamed <i>zanana</i> (زنانة), which is a slang word for nagging wife, a word of which the
                sound imitates the propeller sound. Circling <i>zananat</i> are not just terrorising people with their buzzing, but also disrupt TV reception, invading Palestinian televisions.</p>

              <p>The sound that a drone produces depends on its size. Small commercial drones produce a high-pitched buzzing with their electric motors, usually four or eight. Smaller military drones are launched by hand or with a catapult, and are
                equipped with larger electric motors or small piston engines. The ScanEagle, a military surveillance drone used in more than twelve countries, has a two-stroke engine not unlike those used in a chainsaw or a weed trimmer.</p>
              <p class="indent">The Predator drone has the same four-stroke engine as a snowmobile. The Reaper drone is larger and has a turboprop engine like you would see in a small aircraft. The next generation of drones are equipped with jet
                engines, like the long range surveillance drone Global Hawk which can stay in the air for 34 hours. They are the largest types of drones and use engines like commercial aircraft or military jets, like the X-47B stealth drone which
                uses the same engine as the F-16. For the audio project ‘A Study Into 21<sup>st</sup> Century Drone Acoustics’ seventeen sounds of drones are collected, from small consumer drones to large long-range military drones. All are collected
                from online sources.</p>

              <h3>Chainsaws and snowmobiles</h3>
              <p>The sound that a drone produces depends on its size. Small commercial drones produce a high-pitched buzzing with their electric motors, usually four or eight. Smaller military drones are launched by hand or with a catapult, and are
                equipped with larger electric motors or small piston engines. The ScanEagle, a military surveillance drone used in more than twelve countries, has a two-stroke engine not unlike those used in a chainsaw or a weed trimmer.</p>
              <p class="indent">The Predator drone has the same four-stroke engine as a snowmobile. The Reaper drone is larger and has a turboprop engine like you would see in a small aircraft. The next generation of drones are equipped with jet
                engines, like the long range surveillance drone Global Hawk which can stay in the air for 34 hours. They are the largest types of drones and use engines like commercial aircraft or military jets, like the X-47B stealth drone which
                uses the same engine as the F-16. For the audio project ‘A Study Into 21<sup>st</sup> Century Drone Acoustics’ seventeen sounds of drones are collected, from small consumer drones to large long-range military drones. All are collected
                from online sources.</p>

              <h3>Halo Hellfire</h3>
              <p>While the buzzing of drones is striking fear and terror, the drone operators are thousands of miles away without any audio feedback. Even the video feed is out of sync. Images taken with an infrared camera attached to the drone are
                transmitted by satellite with a two-to-five-second time lapse. Drone operators need to be immersed in sensory input for so-called situational awareness. Like playing a video game, their input is limited to a mediated representation.
                But gamers use surround sound speakers. Drone operators on the other hand, are less immersed. Their video feed is silent, abstracted, dehumanized. The absence of the sounds of war stands in stark contrast to the terror of the engine
                sounds over areas of conflict. The asymmetry of sound emphasizes how conflicts are increasingly fought far away, remotely controlled.</p>
